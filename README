This takes a JSON with a name and optionally domain and returns potentially functional emails. To use, download the nametoemail gem then-

To use a domain in the JSON to get all email combinations:
n = NameToEmail.new(JSON, "name field", false, nil, "domain field", "all")
n.genemails

To use a domain of your choice to get all email combinations:
n = NameToEmail.new(JSON, "name field", true, "domainofyourchoice.com", nil, "all")
n.genemails

To get emails of only one format, change the last argument from "all" to one of the following:
"firstlastdot" for firstname.lastname@domain
"firstinitiallastname" for firstinitiallastname@domain
"firstunderscorelast" for firstname_lastname@domain
"lastnamefirstinitial" for lastnamefirstinitial@domain
"justlast" for lastname@domain

Output formats:
n.jsonwithemails to get a json with the emails appended to each item
n.emaillist to get just the emails
